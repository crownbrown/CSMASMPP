# CSMASMPP
String Primitives and Macros MASM Portfolio Project


This file contains a program which requests 10 integers that fit within a 32-bit signed register. 
All reading and writing is done using Irving Read/Write String ONLY, no use of Read/Write Dec or Int used. 
Reading and writing is done through two macros called throughout the program. 
Integers are read as strings, converted to integers and stored in a 10 element array. 
Integers from arrays are converted back to strings for display. Integer strings are displayed, along with sum and average, which is rounded down. 
All loops are tracked and initiated from main, along with all procedure calls.
